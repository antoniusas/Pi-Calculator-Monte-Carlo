# Pi-Calculator-Monte-Carlo

Estimating Pi, using monte-carlo simulation by taking the relation between the area of a circle and area of a rectangle. With some simple math transformation using equations we can 
isolate pi by itself and then apply the amount of points inside the circle and points outside the circle. The more points one has, the more accurate the pi-value will become.
